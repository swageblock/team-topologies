## The Problem with Org Charts
1. Page 4, line 1 - Can a business optimize for either speed or stability or is it critical to optimize for both?
2. What are some of the challenges when optimizing for these business needs?
3. Are the *actual communication* lines of our organization following the org chart?  To what degree and is this appropriate?
4. Do we optimize for the whole when we make changes by leveraging a systems approach or do we tend to locally optimize?
5. Page 7 - Do we see the three organizational structures in our organization?
6. Page 8 - How does a model that is adaptable to current needs avoid the throws of morale that normal restructuring incurs?
7. How has Conways Law influenced the design and support of our systems?
8. How have we seen cognitive load impact developers and operations staff in the past?
9. Do we consider cognitive load when assigning projects to teams?
10. How does a cognitive load problem impact maintenance activities including: troubleshooting, tuning, adding features, addressing security concerns/patching, and updating infrastructure?

## Conway's Law and Why it Matters
1. Do we have examples of monolithic software implementations?
2. Do we have examples of monolithic hardware implementations?
3. Is there evidence that Conways Law is overcome by organizational culture or PO alignment for us?
4. What are some examples of good and poor communication paths in our organization?
5. Comparing Figure 2.1 and 2.2 (pages 19-20), are there evidences that Conways Law is a certainty?  Why or why not?
6. What friction exists between an architecturally aligned organization structure and the one we have today?
7. If 'Team Assignments are the first draft of the software architecture' how could we create organizational structures that align on the necessary boundaries without a big up front design?  How would this impact the autonomy of the teams after work begins?  
8. Would teams that align to the software components lend itself to the work that the organization has, or would it increase the project complexity and be the same or slower?
9. If teams were aligned to architectural concerns would it make maintenance less costly and new feature work more efficient?
10. Given Conway's Law is true, does that imply the person assigning work is really the first-wave architect? (page 23)
11. Does the decision making process for how teams are assigned work lend itself to staffing plans?
12. Do we spend the time addressing team interactions that should not exist?  Have you ever discovered communication (not the team building kind) across teams that you recognized as inappropriate and indicating a larger problem?
13. How can we take advantage of the remote offices and locations within the buildings?
14. Is there merit to separating tooling such as SC, Release Tools, Agile Backlog mgmt, Logging, Load Balancing, etc to provide more distinct seperation of team responsibilities?  How should we consider other business divisions that we are creating?

## Team-First Thinking
1. In what ways have we seen evidence that teams are more important than the members?  What have we seen that suggests otherwise?
2. Do we enable our teams with a shared goal?
3. Is it valuable to have teams of 5-9 people for us?
4. Are there ways to overcome Dunbar's number?  Culture?  Team Building?  Others?
5. Does Dunbar's number seem to play out in both personal and professional circumstances?
6. Have we seen that a rage of 2 weeks to 3 months is the time it takes for a team to become a high-trust, cohesive, unit?
7. Do we follow with the philosophy of only changing teams occasionally and when necessary?
8. What do we feel is the minimum time for a developer to stay on a team should be?  How could we accomplish rotation without disrupting teams in an undue manner?
9. In which 'horizons' do we see teams thinking/executing?  (see page 36 for horizon definitions)
10.  Do we perceive ownership of components as gardening or policing?
11. Does the practice of annual reviews encourage an egocentric thinking on teams?  What would assessing and rewarding the whole team look like?
12.  Are there teams that have an excess of cognitive load that we should be intervening on right away?
13. What are some examples you have seen of the three types of cognitive load:  
    - Intrinsic 
    - Extraneous
    - Germane
14. What would the outcomes be if we were able to eliminate extraneous cognitive load and diminish intrinsic cognitive load?  How could we accomplish this?
15. When adding teams to a domain, do we see that the teams move equally slow because of the cognitive load problem?
16. How do we currently consider cognitive load when assigning work?
17. What behaviors do we see when a team surpasses its reasonable cognitive load?
18. Are teams empowered to split their domain when it is necessary?
19. Do we appropriately prioritize efforts to ensure fit and usability of the APIs published by teams?
20. Do we facilitate trust, awareness, and knowledge sharing across teams?  
21. Do our facilities cater to each teams needs?
