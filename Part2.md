# Part Two

## Static Team Topologies
1. Have you experienced situations where team structure seems to have detracted from our ability to successfully execute?
2. Have we made any team structure changes that informed only by an immediate need and wasn't made based on team interactions, handoffs, architecture, and cognitive load?
    - Have you seen these changes be successful long term or was intervention necessary?
3. Do we have full stack developers that would eliminate the need for a cross functional team makeup? 
    - When have we seen supporting evidence of this?
    - When have we seen contradictory evidence of this?
    - What devops team makeups have we experimented with?  Where were the results?  
    - What cultural barriers exist to us making cross-functional teams?
    - What space barriers exist to us making cross-functional teams?
    - What leadership/control barriers exist to us making cross-functional teams?
4. Do we desire our development teams to have situational awareness of the software running in production?  Do teams have the necessary expertise to succeed in this endeavor?
5. Do we have the necessary sensing built into the process and org structure to detect the need for change?
6. Does your team's makeup/design impact the success of other teams positively or negatively?  How could it improve?
7. Do your team's varied practices encourage or erode cross-team trust/confidence?
8. What are the tradeoffs among team organization strategies and which do we use today: Feature Teams, Product Teams, Cloud Teams, SRE Teams?
9. Is our cloud approach embracing the opportunities for self service that cloud offers when appropriate?  When is this appropriate?
10. Where do we find ourselves in the matrix presented on page 73?
11. Are we able to detect when teams capabilities are necessitating interactions with other teams?
12. Do we have the visibility necessary when teams interact to take action when the interactions indicate problems?
13. Does our organizational structure have a velocity (speed and direction)?

## Four Fundamental Team Topologies
1. What are teams that fall into the categories provided?
    - Stream-Aligned Teams
    - Enabling Teams
    - Complicated SubSystem Teams
    - Platform Teams
2. What characteristics apply to the teams that you categorized in each of these?
3. Do we have clear organizational Roles?
    ### Stream-Aligned Teams
    page 81 "Team aligned to a single, valuable stream of work;... single product or service, set of features, single user journey, or a single user persona." 
    - Are our SAT's aligned to a valueable stream of work?
    - Are most of our teams SAT's?
    - How much coordination is required when working with Service Teams for the SAT?
    - Do we have the capabilities required for a SAT defined to ensure effective team membership and size?
4. How does the proposed Stream-Aligned team compare/contrast with Product and Feature teams from the previous chapter?
5. Are there any expected behaviors that we do/don't do today on our teams that would be beneficial or not?
    ### Enabling Teams
    page 86 "... specialists in a given technical domain ... they help bridge [the] capability gap."
