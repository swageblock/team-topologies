# Part Three

## Team Interaction Modes
    The Modes:
    - Collaboration: working closely together with another team (page 135)
    - Facilitating: helping another team to clear impediments (page 140)
    - X-as-a-Service: consuming or providing something with minimal collaboration (page 137)
1. Would you say we have well defined interactions between teams?  How does your answer differ when considering DBA's, Infra, and PS?  
2. Do we encourage all teams to interact at an optimal level?  How do we measure that level?    
    page 133 note "Intermittent collaboration found better solutions than constant interaction."
3. Do we think of interactions between teams evolving over the lifecycle of an implementation, possibly starting with one mode and moving to another mode; potentially toggling between modes.
4. How is success or failure of our teams related to the habits and capability of our people?
5. Does having expectations of other teams increase or decrease fulfillment of the team members?
6. Collaboration:
    - When we collaborate, do we have a plan for how teams will discontinue the collaboration exercise?
    - Do we treat the team as a single large resource pool for the duration of the collaboration?
    - Do we consider the cognitive load increase of the additional relationships as well as the ongoing production support activities that each contributing team has?
    - What barriers exist for us when we desire to leverage collaboration?
7. X-as-a-Service:
    - Do we form implementation plans with X-as-a-Service in mind?
    - Are teams allowed to ignore service internals in their consumption?
    - Do we set up X-as-a-Service teams to understand the needs of their consumers?
    - Does this approach detract from the autonomy and knowledge of the systems for development teams and their members?
    - Are Product Owners engaged in the product management aspects of shared libraries?
    - Are X-as-a-Service teams forced to implement use-case-specific features too often?  If so, why?
8. Facilitating:
    - Do we have facilitating teams?  Do we experience that they meet with the advantages listed?
    - Do we have facilitating staff contributing to the code base of other teams?  Are they dependencies for success?
    

## Evolve Team Structures with Organizational Sensing
1. What method (inputs and strategies) do we use to adapt our organization to the new challenges we are presented with?
2. Have we ever employed a new opinionated technology to force ourselves to change the culture and organizational approach?
3. Do we have teams that have problems with predictable delivery caused by high coupling to another team?
4. How have we used the 'discover to establish' pattern?  Was it to a successful outcome?
5. Are there areas between development and infrastructure that don't have clear role/purpose/responsibility definitions?  What are our observations?
6. Do we know when it is time to reorganize?
    - Software has grown too large for one team
    - Delivery cadence is becoming slower
    - Multiple business services rely on a large set of underlying services
7. Do we see these changes?
8. How do we nurture communication between dev and ops?
9. Do we use operational issues as input to the development process?
10. Do our teams have adequate perception of the commercial viability of their softwares?

## The Next Generation Digital Operating Model
1. Do we fall into the paradigm of feature delivery myopia?
2. Are we going to use Conways law as a guiding means of organizing teams?
3. How can we change to allow for sensing when and why teams are interacting?
4. What value streams do we have that we might use to center our teams around?
5. What is the Thinnest Viable Platform for us?
6. How are we going to level up our Managers?
