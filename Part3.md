# Part Three

## Team Interaction Modes
    The Modes:
    - Collaboration: working closely together with another team (page 135)
    - Facilitating: helping another team to clear impediments (page 140)
    - X-as-a-Service: consuming or providing something with minimal collaboration (page 137)
1. Would you say we have well defined interactions between teams?  How does your answer differ when considering DBA's, Infra, and PS?  
2. Do we encourage all teams to interact at an optimal level?  How do we measure that level?    
    page 133 note "Intermittent collaboration found better solutions than constant interaction."
3. Do we think of interactions between teams evolving over the lifecycle of an implementation, possibly starting with one mode and moving to another mode; potentially toggling between modes.
4. How is success or failure of our teams related to the habits and capability of our people?
5. Does having expectations of other teams increase or decrease fulfillment of the team members?
6. Collaboration:
    - When we collaborate, do we have a plan for how teams will discontinue the collaboration exercise?
    - Do we treat the team as a single large resource pool for the duration of the collaboration?
    - Do we consider the cognitive load increase of the additional relationships as well as the ongoing production support activities that each contributing team has?
    - What barriers exist for us when we desire to leverage collaboration?
7. X-as-a-Service:
    - Do we form implementation plans with X-as-a-Service in mind?
    - Are teams allowed to ignore service internals in their consumption?
    - Do we set up X-as-a-Service teams to understand the needs of their consumers?
    - Does this approach detract from the autonomy and knowledge of the systems for development teams and their members?
    - Are Product Owners engaged in the product management aspects of shared libraries?
    - Are X-as-a-Service teams forced to implement use-case-specific features too often?  If so, why?
8. Facilitating:
    - Do we have facilitating teams?  Do we experience that they meet with the advantages listed?
    - Do we have facilitating staff contributing to the code base of other teams?  Are they dependencies for success?
